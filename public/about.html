<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have spent over 25 years working in the food manufacturing industry, but have always had an interest in coding and web design.
   Many years ago (back in the 90's) I designed a few websites but never had a focus to continue. Now I have an opportuniy to do this 
  so have started again from scratch! The internet has changed, web design has changed and I need to catch up.</p>

<p>Asides from an interest in coding and web design, I am also a keen cyclist, particularly mounatin biking and am a regular at the local Windhill bikepark.
  Other hobbies include archery and gaming.
</p>

<p>My partner and I live with our 2 cats - Dusty and Darcy - who are obviously the masters of the household. THey have allowed me to continue with 
  learning web design as long I make sure to provide kibbles at regular times and a small bowl of tuna in the evening.
