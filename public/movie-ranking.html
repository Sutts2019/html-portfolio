<h1>The Best Movies According to Alan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Terminator</h3>
<p>The original of course! Dated now but I still think this is one of the best Sci Fi movies ever</p>
<h3>The Usual Suspects</h3>
<p>Again, slightly dated, but such an amazing twist at the end!</p>
<h3>Conan the Barbarian</h3>
<p>Another Arnie classic, but I love it.</p>
